simple C bitmap library

This is a simple bitmap library I developed to aid my other projects.

This mainly provides interface for you to use individual bits for data manipulation,
rather than providing means for bitmap image processing.

For when meta data security is enabled, the randomness used is generated from ISAAC, seeded with time.
